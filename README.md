#**Inventures Software Development Way**

Here we define rules and aligments to collaborate and ensure we give our users high quality user experiences.

This guideline is structured around 2 sections: set-up and ongoing, each divided in several chapters as follows:

* Setup
	* Setting-up your machine
	* Services accounts
	* Configuring Visual Studio Code 
	* Git configuration

* Ongoing
	* Does and dont's when developing
	* Team managment tools: Trello & Slack
	* Git flow practices

## Setup

### Setting-up your machine

At Inventures we use the software most recent versions **with long term support**. Align with the team on the specific tools and versions to be used, but most likely you will need to have:

* git
* node (do not use odd versions)
* npm
* yarn
* nvm
* mongoDB
* postgreSQL
* angular/cli

### Services accounts

You have to sign up with your inventures email to all the services that you will use. **You must "log in with Google" to keep our clients information safe**. The services might change over time and could be project specific, yet very likely you will need to sign up to

* Bitbucket
* Github
* Trello
* Slack
* AWS
* Google Cloud
* Azure

## Create a file

Next, you’ll add a new file to this repository.

1. Click the **New file** button at the top of the **Source** page.
2. Give the file a filename of **contributors.txt**.
3. Enter your name in the empty file space.
4. Click **Commit** and then **Commit** again in the dialog.
5. Go back to the **Source** page.

Before you move on, go ahead and explore the repository. You've already seen the **Source** page, but check out the **Commits**, **Branches**, and **Settings** pages.

## Clone a repository

Use these steps to clone from SourceTree, our client for using the repository command-line free. Cloning allows you to work on your files locally. If you don't yet have SourceTree, [download and install first](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/). If you prefer to clone from the command line, see [Clone a repository](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/4whODQ).

1. You’ll see the clone button under the **Source** heading. Click that button.
2. Now click **Check out in SourceTree**. You may need to create a SourceTree account or log in.
3. When you see the **Clone New** dialog in SourceTree, update the destination path and name if you’d like to and then click **Clone**.
4. Open the directory you just created to see your repository’s files.

Now that you're more familiar with your Bitbucket repository, go ahead and add a new file locally. You can [push your change back to Bitbucket with SourceTree](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/iqyBMg), or you can [add, commit,](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8QhODQ) and [push from the command line](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/NQ0zDQ).
