# **Inventures Software Development Way**

**This is a live document - no dogma, no final truth - it's up tu us to keep it relevant**

**Objective**

To spend less time finding bugs, solving merge conflicts, re-inventing the wheel so we can spend more time developing great experiences for our clients (and doing whatever else we want) 

------------------------
Here we define rules and alignments to collaborate and ensure we give our users high quality user experiences.

This guideline is structured around 2 sections: set-up and ongoing, each divided in several chapters as follows:

* Setup
	* Setting-up your machine
	* Services accounts
	* Visual Studio Code configuration
	* Git configuration

* Ongoing
	* Team management tools: Trello & Slack
	* Dos and don'ts when developing
	* Git flow practices
	* TypeScript Comments


------------------------

## Setup

### Setting-up your machine

At Inventures we use the software most recent versions **with long term support**. Align with the team on the specific tools and versions to be used, but most likely you will need to have:

* git
* node (do not use odd versions)
* npm
* yarn
* nvm
* mongoDB
* postgreSQL
* angular/cli
* Visual Studio Code
* Robo 3T

### Services accounts

You have to sign up with your inventures email to all the services that you will use. **You must "log in with Google"** to keep our clients information safe. The services might change over time and could be project specific, yet very likely you will need to sign up to

* Bitbucket
* NPM
* Github
* Trello
* Slack
* AWS
* Google Cloud
* Azure
* APIARY


### Git configuration and safety considerations

Simply, make sure before you do anything in a new project, that you create your branch (details regarding branch usage covered in subsequent section) a .gitignore file, making sure you at least add: 

* .env - To avoid the risk of committing credentials
* .node_modules - Then repo will be massive and that will remain in the history
* /dist - Distribution files

**Do not** hardcode any credential or password in a file that you are not including into the .gitignore file. Otherwise we will be left exposed by having that info committed in our branches history

See a .gitignore file example inside the example folder

### Intelectual property

Do include a license.txt to all repositories, use the file on example folder as reference but always validate with Alex Hazbun.

### Visual Studio Code Configuration

1. Copyrights
	* Add [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=psioniq.psi-header) to your VSC to handle creation of copyright headers
	* Configure your VSC with the following configuration replacing author name and email:

```JSON
{   
  "psi-header.config": {
    "forceToTop": true,
    "blankLinesAfter": 6,
    "license": "Custom"
  },
  "psi-header.changes-tracking": {
    "isActive": true,
    "modAuthor": "Modified By: ",
    "modDate": "Last Modified: ",
    "modDateFormat": "date",
    "include": [],
    "exclude": ["markdown", "json"],
    "autoHeader": "autoSave"
  },
  "psi-header.variables":[
    [
      "projectCreationYear",
      "2019"
    ],
    [
      "company",
      "Inventures - www.inventures.cl"
    ],
    [
      "copyrightholder",
      "Incrementa Ventures SpA"
    ],
    [
      "author",
      "Mario Merino"
    ],
    [
      "authoremail",
      "mario@inventures.cl"
    ]
  ],
  "psi-header.templates":[
    {
      "language":"*",
      "template":[
        "File: <<filename>>",
        "Project: <<projectname>>",
        "File Created: <<filecreated('dddd, Do MMMM YYYY h:mm:ss a')>>",
        "Author: <<author>> (<<authoremail>>)",
        "-----",
        "Last Modified: <<dateformat('dddd, Do MMMM YYYY h:mm:ss a')>>",
        "Modified By: <<author>> (<<authoremail>>)",
        "-----",
        "Copyright <<projectCreationYear>> - <<year>> <<copyrightholder>>. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED",
        "Terms and conditions defined in license.txt",
        "-----",
        "<<company>>"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
2- Configure eslint and prettier. For tslint you should create a file similar to the one added into the examples
```JSON
{  
  "editor.formatOnSave":true,
  "javascript.format.enable":false,
  "prettier.eslintIntegration":true,
  "typescript.updateImportsOnFileMove.enabled":"never",
  "prettier.singleQuote":true,
  "editor.tabSize":2,
  "editor.insertSpaces":true,
  "editor.detectIndentation":false
}
```

## Ongoing

### Dos and don'ts when developing

**‚úÖ Dos**
* DRY: do not repeat yourself, i.e. factor your code in reusable modules
* TYPINGS: use typings as much as posible so to prevent type injection erros
* Use Merge Squash for pull request to make it easier to find different pull requests
* Whenever creating a new file make sure the copyrights have been added
* Send pull request often, as a rule of thumb do not accumulate more than one day of work
* Document using TSDoc/JSDoc guidelines (see example below) - particularly for logic intensive features (e.g. redux)
* Use a service to console.log only in development mode - use husky to ensure only the logger service is used
* Add API and external suscriptions such as Firebase, Google maps, etc as an environment variable

**‚ò†Ô∏è don'ts üö®**
* Use <any> in TypeScript - if there is no work-around be ready to have a good explanation
* Send a pull request without ensuring you have the most up to date version of the development branch
* Use production environment variables in you local environment


### Git flow practices

We follow Atlasian git flow practices ([here you can read more details](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/using-branches-in-bitbucket-server-776639968.html)) 

#### Branch structure:
* **Permament Branches:**
	* **master**: Contains the production version of the code.
	* **release/{x.x.x}**: Contains the release version of the code. This might differ from *dev* since we might want to lock a stagging stage whilst keep working on additiona features. This branch deploys to *stagging*. We follow the [semantic convention] (https://semver.org/) to specify the version.
	* **dev**: Development branch. Contains the most up to date version of the code. All approved features merge into this branch
* **Temporary branches**
	* **feature/{developer_name}/{feature_name}**: Temprorary branch created by each developer to work on a specific new feature. It branches from, and merges back into, the dev branch using pull requests. Please use descriptive names for the feature and avoid adding commits not related to the named feature.
	* **bugfix/{developer_name}/{bug_name}**: Used to fix a staging branch without interrupting changes in the development branch, thus it branches out from the *master*. Changes should be merged into the *master* **and** *dev* branches.
	* **hotfix/{developer_name}/{hot_bug_name}**: Used to quickly fix a Production branch without interrupting changes in the development branch, thus it branches from *master*. Changes should be merged into the *master* **and** *dev* branches.
	
#### Git flow:
* **feature**: 
Main goal is to ensure you start working from the most recent version of *dev* and that the pull request has the most recent version of *dev* at the moment of generating the pull request. There are several ways to achive this, for example:
 1. check out *dev*
 2. pull *dev*
 3. branch from *dev* following the name convention *feature/{developer_name}/{feature_name}*
 4. work on your branch, and commit following the commit guidelines
 5. run tests locally
 6. check out *dev* 
 7. pull *dev*
 8. check out your feature branch
 9. merge with dev
 10. push your feature branch
 11. create a pull request to merge into *dev*
* **bugfix**: Same as *feature* but using *staging* instead of *dev* for branching from and merging into.
* **hotfix**: Same as *feature* but using *master* instead of *dev* for branching from and merging into.

#### Commit structure:
**do start** all your commits with one of these prefixed types:
* feat (feature)
* fix (bug fix)
* docs (documentation)
* style (formatting, missing semi colons, ‚Ä¶)
* refactor
* test (when adding missing tests)
* maitain (update packages, solve yarn/npm warnings)

### TS Comments
Commenting your code is as important as writing the code itself since it allows us to share, review and build upon eachothers work.
We adopted the Typescript guidelines to comment the code [TSDoc](https://github.com/Microsoft/tsdoc) so we can use tools as [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/guides/doccomments/) to produce automated documentation to navigate and understand our code. Below ther is an example:
```TypeScript
export class Statistics {
  /**
   * Returns the average of two numbers.
   *
   * @remarks
   * This method is part of the {@link core-library#Statistics | Statistics subsystem}.
   *
   * @param x - The first input number
   * @param y - The second input number
   * @returns The arithmetic mean of `x` and `y`
   *
   * @beta
   */
  public static getAverage(x: number, y: number): number {
    return (x + y) / 2.0;
  }
}
```
